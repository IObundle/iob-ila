# IOb ILA Linux Kernel Drivers
- Structure:
    - `drivers/`: directory with linux kernel module drivers for iob_ila
        - `iob_ila_main.c`: driver source
        - `[iob_ila.h]` and `[iob_ila_sysfs.h]`: header files generated by:
        ```bash
        python3 .path/to/iob-linux/scripts/drivers.py iob_ila -o [output_dir]
        ```
        - `driver.mk`: makefile segment with `iob_ila-obj:` target for driver
          compilation
    - `iob_ila.dts`: device tree template with iob_ila and monitor nodes
        - manually add the `ila` and `monitor` nodes to the system device tree
          so the iob_ila and iob_monitor is recognized by the linux kernel
        - **NOTE**: monitor requires `iob_pfsm` drivers
